/* Functions for reading and writing endian-specific values */

/* These functions read and write data of the specified endianness, 
   dynamically translating to the host machine endianness.

   e.g.: If you want to read a 16 bit value on big-endian machine from
         an open file containing little endian values, you would use:
		value = SDL_ReadLE16(rp);
         Note that the read/write functions use SDL_RWops pointers
         instead of FILE pointers.  This allows you to read and write
         endian values from large chunks of memory as well as files 
         and other data sources.
